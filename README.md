Tries to implement https://gist.github.com/orta/f80db73c6e8211211e3d224a5ab47624 so that folks can figure out what works and what doesn't.

Currently uses a fork of TypeScript which exposes the types in TS2322 error messages so that an outside client can use them. You can see that here: https://github.com/orta/TypeScript/pull/new/diagnostic_types
